The stock markets provide a secure and regulated environment where market participants can transact in shares and other eligible financial instruments with confidence, with zero to low operational risk. Operating under the defined rules as stated by the regulator, the stock markets act as primary markets and secondary markets. 
The stock market, as a primary market, allows corporations to issue and sell shares to the general public for the first time through an initial public offering (IPO). This practice aids businesses in obtaining the funding they require from investors. It essentially means that a company divides itself into a number of shares for example, 20 million shares and sells a portion of those shares to the public at a price.
A corporation will require a marketplace where these shares can be sold to make this process easier. The stock market provides this marketplace. If all goes according to plan, the corporation will be able to sell 5 million shares at a $10 per share price and make a profit of $50 million. Investors will receive company shares, which they can expect to hold for the term of their choice, in the hopes of a rise in share price and potential dividend payments. The stock exchange operates as a facilitator for this capital-raising process, receiving a fee from the company and its financial partners in exchange for its services.
