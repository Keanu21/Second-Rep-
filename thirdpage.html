  One of the most important aspects of a free market economy is the stock market. It enables businesses to raise funds by issuing stock and corporate bonds. It allows ordinary investors to share in a company's financial success, profit from capital gains, and receive money from dividendsâ€”though losses are also conceivable. While institutional investors and professional money managers benefit from some advantages due to their big resources, superior knowledge, and greater risk-taking ability, the stock market tries to provide a level playing field for ordinary people.
  The stock market serves as a platform for individuals to efficiently channel their savings and investments into profitable investment possibilities. In the long run, this aids the country's capital formation and economic progress.
