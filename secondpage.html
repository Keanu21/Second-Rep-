  The stock exchange must ensure that all interested market participants have quick access to data for all buy and sell orders, based on established supply and demand principles, thereby assisting in the fair and transparent pricing of securities. It should also be capable of efficiently matching appropriate buy and sell orders.
  The act of determining the right price of a security is normally conducted by examining market supply and demand, as well as other aspects involved with the transactions, and stock markets must enable an efficient method for price discovery. 
  
  While the stock market has no influence over the quantity of buyers and sellers for a given financial security, it must ensure that anybody who is eligible and wants to trade has immediate access to place orders that should be executed at a fair price. 
  While more participants are vital for a market's smooth operation, the same market must also ensure that all participants are verified and adhere to the appropriate rules and regulations, leaving no room for any of the parties to default. It should also verify that all related firms operating in the market follow the regulations and operate within the legal framework established by the regulator.
  
  A marketplace is made up of a variety of participants, which include market makers, investors, traders, speculators, and hedgers. All of these participants operate in the stock market, with different roles and functions. For instance, an investor may buy stocks and hold them for the long term, spanning many years, while a trader may enter and exit a position within seconds. A market maker provides necessary liquidity in the market, while a hedger may like to trade in derivatives for mitigating the risk involved in investments. The stock market should ensure that all such participants are able to operate seamlessly, fulfilling their desired roles to ensure that the market continues to operate efficiently.
  Along with wealthy and institutional investors, a very large number of small investors are also served by the stock market for their small amount of investments. These investors may have limited financial knowledge and not be fully aware of the pitfalls of investing in stocks and other listed instruments. The stock exchange must implement necessary measures to offer the necessary protection to such investors to shield them from financial loss and ensure customer trust.
